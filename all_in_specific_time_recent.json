          "decision_conditions": ["By reason of their narrow front elevations, narrow plot widths, excessive height next to neighbouring bungalows and close proximity to one another, the proposed dwellings would form an oversized and visually cramped addition to the street scene, harming its character and appearance. Due to the mentioned features, as well as the fact that the proposal would provide inadequate amenity space for plot 3 and substandard internal layouts for future occupants of all dwellings, the proposal is considered to be an overdevelopment of the site. The proposal is therefore detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area and is contrary to Policy BE1 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One - Strategic Policies, Policies DMHB 11 and DMHB 12 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), as well as paragraphs 130 (a) and 130 (c) of the NPPF (2021).", "Each of the 4 bedroom semi detached dwellings (Plot 2 and 3) fails to provide a twin/double bedroom with a minimum internal floor space of 11.5sqm. Furthermore the smallest bedroom within each of the properties is below the single bedroom minimum internal space requirement  (7.5sqm). Additionally, Plot 1 of the proposed development includes a study/bedroom which fails to provide 7.5sqm of internal floor space for its occupants. The proposed dwellings are therefore considered to be of poor design and are contrary to policy D6 (F) of the London Plan (2021).", "The entrance level W/C's within each of the dwellings fails to meet the requisite space standards set out in Diagram 27 of Approved Document M to the Building Regulations. They also fail to provide the required clear access zones set out in Diagram 27 of Approved Document M to the Building Regulations. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D7 A(2) of the London Plan, which requires all houses (which are created via works to which Part M volume 1 of the Building Regulations applies) to meet Building Regulation requirement M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings'.", "Plot 3 would provide 91sqm of private amenity space for future occupants of the 4 bedroom dwelling, it would therefore fail to comply with Policy DMHB 18 of the Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two - Development Management Policies (2020) and is considered to provide a substandard level of private amenity space for future occupants of the property.", "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to all relevant planning legislation, regulations, guidance, circulars and Council policies, including The Human Rights Act (1998) (HRA 1998) which makes it unlawful for the Council to act incompatibly with Convention rights, specifically Article 6 (right to a fair hearing); Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life); Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).", "The decision to REFUSE planning permission has been taken having regard to the policies and proposals in the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1 (2012) and Part 2 (2020) set out below, including Supplementary Planning Guidance, and to all relevant material considerations, including The London Plan (2021).", "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies from the  Local Plan Part 1, Local Plan Part 2, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service.", "This is a reminder that under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Hillingdon Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Hillingdon CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.", "For more information on CIL matters please visit the planning portal page at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil"],
